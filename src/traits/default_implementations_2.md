# Default Implementations

Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those
methods do not have a default implementation.

A trait can provide a large amount of functionality even if types that
implement the trait only implement a fraction of the methods.

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}

let tweet = Tweet {
    username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
    content: String::from("of course, as you probably already know, people"),
    reply: false,
    retweet: false,
};

println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
```

Here, we get the behavior of the `summarize` method for free because we
implemented `summarize_author`.
