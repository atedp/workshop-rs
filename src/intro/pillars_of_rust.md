# Pillars of Rust

### __Memory safety without garbage collection__: Rust uses _ownership_ to enforce access control of data at compile time

### __Concurrency without data races__: Also a product of the _ownership_ system

### __Zero cost abstractions__: _Traits_. Rust is similar to C++:

>  C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you don't use,
>  you don't pay for [Stroustrup, 1994]. And further: What you do use, you
>  couldn't hand code any better.
>
> -- Stroustrup
