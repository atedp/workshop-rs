# Introduction

_Generics_ are abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other properties.

They help us effectively handle the duplication of concepts.

There are three generics related concepts in Rust that are important:
-  _Generic data types_: An abstract type that expresses ranges for concrete
   types.
- _Traits_: Used to define behavior in a generic way.
- _Lifetimes_: A variety of generics that gives the compiler information about
  how references relate to one another.

Today, we're just going to focus on the syntax and use of _generic data types_.
