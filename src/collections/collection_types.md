# Collection Types

Collections fall into four major categories:

- Sequences: `Vec`, `VecDeque`, `LinkedList`
- Maps: `HashMap`, `BTreeMap`
- Sets: `HashSet`, `BTreeSet`
- Misc: `BinaryHeap`

`Vec` and `HashMap` are the most commonly used.

`Vec` (called _vector_) stores a variable number of values next to each other.

`HashMap` associates values with a particular key.

In comparison, other types are consider _niche_.
