# The Preview Subcommand

As a refresher, this is the expected behavior of `preview`:

```sh
$ emoji-fzf preview
grinning face smile happy joy :D grin
grimacing face grimace teeth
...
united_nations un flag banner
pirate_flag skull crossbones flag banner
```

The name of the emoji is printed, followed by a list of associated keywords, on
the same line.
